            <h3 class="h3-default"> Coding </h3>
            <p> I enjoy writing code, building websites, working on UI designs, making other designs in general, working with Aurdino, coding simple stuff in python, and many more! I know HTML, CSS, and a little bit of C, C++, Javascript, and Python.
                Check out my coding projects page to see some of the stuff I've made! </p>

        <div class="chess">
            <h3 class="h3-default"> Chess </h3>
            <p> I have been playing chess for over five years. I play regularly on online chess sites, such as Lichess and Chess.com. I have also played a few chess tournaments, representing
                my school, and have won many prizes. Besides, I also have a FIDE Rating, of 1539, and an Online Fide Arena International Master (FOA AIM) Title. </p>

        <div class="quizzing">
            <h3 class="h3-default"> Quizzing </h3>
            <p> I like quizzing, and learning new things in general! Particularly, I like reading about history, and sciences. I have participated in multiple quizzes, winning a few of them. Besides, I also like reading non-fiction books.  I have
                written multiple exams on science and math subjects, scoring well in most of them. Check out my miscellaneous page to see some of the other stuff I like!
